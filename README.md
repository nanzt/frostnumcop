Codes created to map permafrost distribution using satellite temperature data and subregion survey maps. 
The methodolog is described in the following article:

Hu J, Zhao S, Nan Z, Wu X, Sun X. A novel approach for mapping permafrost in a large area using subregion maps and satellite data. 
Permafrost and Periglacial Processes. 2020, 31(4): 548-560. doi:10.1002/ppp.2068.

The release v1.0-essd was used to create the 2010 permafrost map on the Tibet plateau, which was published on the article:

Cao Z, Nan Z, Hu J, Chen Y, Zhang Y. A new 2010 permafrost distribution map over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau based on subregion survey maps: 
a benchmark for regional permafrost modeling. Earth System Science Data. 2023, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2022-206.

The release v1.0-essd has been registered as https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8301453.
